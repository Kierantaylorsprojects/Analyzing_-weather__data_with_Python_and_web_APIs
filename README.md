# Analyzing_weather__data_with_Python_and_web_APIs
## Summary

In this project, I created a python script and utilized API's (CitiPy and OpenWeatherMap) in order to graph different weather patterns of major cities around the globe in relationship to their latitude. 

I then utilized linear regression modules and scatter plots to break down these regions based on hemisphere and weather patterns. 

These Weather Patterns included tempature, humidity, cloudiness and wind speed. 

For the second part of my analysis, I used Python the GeoApify API and the GeoViews API to show humidity in cities, prefered weather condiontions, hotels in prefered cities to allow for the user to see the cities and hotels in a hover message for each point on the map.
